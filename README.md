# Hello-World

This is my first foray into coding, Github and my future career!  I was a teacher in Korea for 15 years and loved it there, but had reached what I considered to be the end of one's ability to progress upward.  Now that I have returned to the US, I am excited about entering a new field.  It's all so exciting!
